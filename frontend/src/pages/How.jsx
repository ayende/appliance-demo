In this page we'll take a deep dive into its building blocks and how it works.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Hugin is built using the following technologies:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (1GHz quad-core, 512MB RAM) (any Raspberry Pi with WiFi will do)</li>
                                        <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32 Bits, Bullseye)</li>
                                        <li><strong>Database:</strong> RavenDB 6.0</li>
                                        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> JavaScript (node.js, Express, React)</li>
                                        <li><strong>Disk: </strong> 32 GB micro SD card</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Internal structure</h3>
                                    <p>Hugin is an appliance running the Linux OS, designed to be completely plug & play. Once you plug it to power, it establishes an open WiFi hotspot and sets up a captive portal to direct connections to this website. You can read all about this in the following <ExternalLink href="https://ayende.com/blog/200675-A/walkthrough-turning-a-raspberry-pi-into-an-appliance?key=601a5e9e8f8f47239a47d4d16a11faf9">blog post</ExternalLink>.</p>
                                    <p>Inside the Pi, we are have the following key components:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>RavenDB:</strong> an awesome database that can hold all the data and respond <em>quickly</em> to queries.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Nginx:</strong> responsible for routing requests and part of the captive portal setup.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> written in node.js & express, processing the queries from this web application and talking to RavenDB directly.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>

                                    <h3>Connecting to the appliance</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The device you are holding is running Linux and is accessible via SSH with the following credentials: <code>rdb</code> / <code>awesome</code> while connected to the <code>Hugin (ravendb)</code> network.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Getting in touch with us</h3>
                                    <p>We would love to hear from you, please visit our <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/discussions?utm_source=appliance&utm_medium=embedded-app&utm_campaign=hugin">Github discussions page</ExternalLink> if you have any questions or suggestions.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Default data sets</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Hugin comes pre-loaded with a few Stack Exchange communities, so you can start using it immeidately. We chose to include the following communities: <code>raspberrypi.stackexchange.com</code>, <code>unix.stackexchange.com</code>, <code>serverfault.com</code>, and <code>superuser.com</code>. We selected those communities because they offer good coverage of DevOps topic and are very useful for offline scenarios.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In total, the dataset contains <em>4.3 million documents</em> and over <em>2.6 million Q&As</em>, while it consumes just over 5GB of disk space. This is possible due to RavenDB using document compression. Without it, the data size is about 11GB.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        RavenDB's document compression feature can reduce the disk space used by over 50%. Additionally, it allows us to decrease the number of disk operations and IOPS in the system. An important fact, given that the disk we are using is a micro SD card.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This situation mimics most cloud environments where you may be paying a <em>lot</em> for better disks and IOPS to meet your needs. This feature can dramatically reduce your costs.</p>

                                    <h3 className="mt-5 mb-3">Why did we put RavenDB on a Raspberry?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In short, because we can! Because it is cool! And because it is fun!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        RavenDB running on Raspberry Pi isn't just a gimmick, it is an important use case for us. When it comes to deploying RavenDB as part of Internet of Things, we are often running on Raspberry Pi or similar hardware. This appliance is perfect for showing how you can run databases as part of edge deployments.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        RavenDB is managing gigabytes of information while running on a constrained device with about 512MB of RAM and (a slow) SD card for storage. We stacked the cards against us being able to deliver a good user experience and a nice application. Despite all the hurdles we put in the way, Hugin (utilizing RavenDB) is able to provide a very responsive user experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In your environment, providing RavenDB with more resources allows you to experience it delivering cutting-edge performance and throughput at any load.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Querying</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        RavenDB uses indexes to speed up queries, enabling efficient data searching as well as providing statistics on tags distributions. These indexes are defined as part of the backend code. You can click on the buttons below to view their definitions. RavenDB indexes allow you to shift the workload from query time to indexing time, ensuring a very fast experience for you, the user, even when running on a very low-end machine or a cloud instance.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>How did we obtain the data?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The data we are using for this project was taken from the <ExternalLink href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">Stack Exchange Data Dump</ExternalLink> on archive.org. We took the data sets from the sites focused on administration and DevOps, so we could generate a dataset to be used offline that would be <em>useful</em> for actual in-field work. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You can add your own communities to the dataset, visit the archive.org <ExternalLink href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">Stack Exchange Data Dump</ExternalLink> and download the data sets you want. Then, you can use the following <ExternalLink href="https://gist.github.com/ayende/50cd2f071547016a635adf21292fd0bc">code snippet</ExternalLink> to import the data into RavenDB. You'll also need to provide an <code>svg</code> icon file for the community, to get the UI to display it properly.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Can I get an offline Stack Overflow?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The Stack Overflow data dump is <em>huge</em>. Even with compression, it is over 50GB in size (and without compression) it is much bigger. You'll need to either connect an additional disk to the Raspberry Pi or use a bigger micro SD card to manage that.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Note that the primary limitation here is the amount of disk space that you have. RavenDB can handle that much data without any issues, even on a machine as small as the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Stack Overflow data dump is distributed using multiple files, so you'll need to update the <ExternalLink href="https://gist.github.com/ayende/50cd2f071547016a635adf21292fd0bc">code snippet</ExternalLink> to handle that (instead of assuming all the files are in the same archive file). But aside from that, it works just fine.
